## PAABAN PANDA
## ELECTRICAL ENGGINEERING

### OVERVIEW

##### PROBLEM STATEMENT

#### Time limiter for social media sites
Make a chrome extension that limits time on social media sites, and blocks said sites after a fixed amount of time.

Features can include:
- Block a specific site after fixed usage per day
- Block all sites after a fixed net usage per day
- Block certain sites during certain times of the day
- Suggest productive websites as an alternative when social media sites are blocked
Brownie points out if the extension can work cross-platform (including
mobile)

##### IMPACT
This chrome extension restrains the user from overusing any social websites by giving an alert after using the social site for a specific duration of time. It also blocks the websites during a period of day.

##### DETAILED SOLUTION
The extension has the following features:-
1)	Blocks the website after fixed usage per day.
After using any social site for 10 minutes it closes the site by showing a page like this:-

![timeout_page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122373317/224470593-aa1bae54-1dd0-434c-8511-9b9c2a84e16f.png)

generateCSSforLimitingDuration() function gives the CSS behind the page and generateHTMLforLimitingDuration() function gives the HTML behind the page as defined above in code.

2)	Suggest some useful websites after the time limit exceeds.

Following suggestions are made after sites being blocked.
